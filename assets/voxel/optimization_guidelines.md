# Voxel Asset Optimization Guidelines

- Use MagicaVoxel's export settings to minimize polygon count.
- Limit texture resolution to 64x64 or 128x128 for mobile/web.
- Prefer .obj or .glb for 3D, .png for backgrounds.
- Remove unused vertices and faces in Blender before export.
- Test assets on low-end devices for performance.
- Use Flame's sprite batching for repeated elements.
